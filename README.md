ToDoApp is an open source Todo App that has not been published yet but will be in the near future. It is based on Uncle Bob's approach 
of clean architecture and seperating concerns. If you would like to read more about that approach you'll find this link helpful: https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture
If you would like to be a part of this app and help make it better, you are welcome to contribute. This app still has a long way to go in terms
of features, material design, and best coding practices. 
Thank you.
